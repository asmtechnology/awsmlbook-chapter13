Machine Learning is a discipline within Artificial Intelligence that deals with creating algorithms that learn from data.  Machine learning traces its roots to a computer program created in 1959 by a computer scientist Arthur Samuel while working for IBM. Samuelâ€™s program could play a game of checkers and was based on assigning each position on the board a score that indicated the likelihood of leading towards winning the game.  The positional scores were refined by having the program play against itself, and with each iteration the performance of the program improved. The program was in effect, learning from experience, and the field of machine learning was born. 
Machine learning specifically deals with the problem of creating computer programs that can generalize and predict information reliably, quickly, and with accuracy resembling what a human would do with similar information. Machine learning algorithms require a lot of processing and storage space, and until recently were only possible to deploy in very large companies, or in academic institutions. Recent advances in storage, processor, GPU technology and the ability to rapidly create new virtual computing resources in the cloud have finally provided the processing power require to build and deploy machine learning systems at scale, and get results in real-time.
