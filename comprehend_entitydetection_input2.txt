Machine learning systems can be trained to build a profile of a user based on the manner in which they use a website or a mobile application. Specifically such systems create a profile of the user based on analyzing information on where the access the platform from, at what times of the day, where they click on a page, how long they stay on a page, how quickly they move their mouse across a page, etc. Once the system has been trained, it can be used to provide real time information on the likelihood that someone is impersonating a customer.
